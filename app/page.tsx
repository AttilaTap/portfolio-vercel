        <p>
          I'm a lifelong problem solver with a strong background in supply chain operations, logistics, and business management â€” and now I'm diving deeper into the world of
          development. After years of optimizing systems and solving complex real-world challenges, Iâ€™ve found that many of the same skills transfer beautifully into writing clean,
          functional, and scalable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I speak Hungarian, English, and German fluently, and I thrive at the intersection of structure and creativity â€” whether thatâ€™s designing internal tools, writing
          automation scripts, or learning about AI and machine learning. I'm deeply interested in every part of development: front-end, back-end, databases, scripting, and building
          useful stuff that actually makes a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may not be in my early twenties, but thatâ€™s exactly what gives me an edge â€” I bring perspective, discipline, and the drive to constantly learn and build. Every project
          you see here reflects that mindset.
